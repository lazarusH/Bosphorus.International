# Course Management Feature - Summary

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Environment Configuration ✅
- Created `.env.local` with actual Supabase credentials using MCP
- Created `.env.example` as a template for future reference
- Project URL: `https://npjftlviicnodszgfnth.supabase.co`

### 2. Add Course Functionality ✅
- **Modal Popup**: Course form now appears in a clean modal overlay
- **Simplified Form**: Only 2 fields required:
  - **Course Name**: Text input for the course name
  - **Type**: Dropdown with two options:
    - Theoretical
    - Theory and Practical
- **Auto-numbering**: Course numbers are automatically generated (incremental)
- **Clean UI**: Modal has close button, cancel, and submit buttons

### 3. User Interface Changes
- Removed the large course form section from the admin page
- Added a prominent "Add New Course" button in the top-right area
- Button opens a modal popup when clicked
- Modal closes automatically after successful course addition

## How to Use

1. **Navigate to Admin Dashboard**
   - Login to your admin account
   - You'll see the admin dashboard

2. **Add a New Course**
   - Click the "Add New Course" button (top-right, black button with + icon)
   - A modal will appear
   - Fill in:
     - Course Name (e.g., "Skin Structure and Function")
     - Type (select either "Theoretical" or "Theory and Practical")
   - Click "Add Course" to save
   - The modal will close and the course list will refresh

3. **Course Number**
   - Automatically assigned (you don't need to enter it)
   - Starts from 1 and increments for each new course

## Files Modified

1. `app/admin/AddCourseForm.tsx` - Converted to modal component
2. `app/admin/page.tsx` - Added button and modal integration
3. `.env.local` - Configured with Supabase credentials
4. `.env.example` - Created template file

## Technical Details

- Course numbers are auto-generated by querying the highest existing course number and adding 1
- Form validation ensures all fields are filled
- Error handling for duplicate courses
- Success feedback with automatic modal close
- Responsive design works on all screen sizes

## Next Steps (Optional)

If you want to update existing courses in the database to match the new type format:
- Current seed data uses: "Theory", "Practical", "Theoretical and practical"
- New format uses: "Theoretical", "Theory and Practical"

You can either:
1. Keep existing courses as-is (they'll still work)
2. Update the seed.sql file to match the new format
3. Manually update existing courses through the database

## Notes

- The dev server is already running on `http://localhost:3000`
- All changes are live and ready to test
- The modal has a clean, professional design matching your existing UI
